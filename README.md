#Project Validation
##General
This project began as an attempt to automate the data processing part of anaytical method validation. While Excel remains a popular tool for basic data processing, some elements specifically Limit Of Detection (LOD) and Limit Of Quantitation (LOQ), are time-consuming and difficult to compute as they require the *standard error of the y-intercept*, which is labor intensive to do.
Since then, it has expanded from a script to a complete program to handle the entire process of method validation. The process is quite painfull and time-consuming with low-level solutions, but is typically done infrequently.
###Method Validation
Method Validation is the process of evaluating the performance of an analytical method by specifying a number of statistical parameters.
